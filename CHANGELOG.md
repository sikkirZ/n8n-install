# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Caddy + self-signed / custom PEM** - Caddy 2.10+ could try ACME when a site hostname was not listed in the certificate SAN. The stack now imports `global-auto-https.conf` with `auto_https disable_certs` whenever file-based TLS is active, expands self-signed SANs from every `{$*_HOSTNAME}` in the `Caddyfile`, uses a safe default for `email` when `LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL` is empty, and drops the invalid `internal` default in `docker-compose.yml`.

### Added
- **Local TLS** - `scripts/setup_custom_tls.sh --generate-self-signed` builds a self-signed certificate (SANs from `.env` `*_HOSTNAME` and `USER_DOMAIN_NAME`, plus localhost). Arbitrary cert/key paths are accepted and copied into `./certs/` for Caddy. New `make setup-tls-self-signed` and `make setup-tls ARGS=...`.
- **Install wizard TLS** - During `make install`, step 3 (`03_generate_secrets.sh`) prompts for HTTPS mode: Let's Encrypt, self-signed, or custom certificate files (`CADDY_TLS_MODE` in `.env`). `doctor` no longer warns about an empty `LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL` when TLS mode is not Let's Encrypt.

## [1.4.2] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed
- **n8n** - Make `N8N_PAYLOAD_SIZE_MAX` configurable via `.env` (was hardcoded to 256, ignoring user overrides)
- **Uptime Kuma** - Fix healthcheck failure (`wget: not found`) by switching to Node.js-based check

## [1.4.1] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- **Supabase Storage** - Fix crash-loop (`Region is missing`) by adding missing S3 storage configuration variables (`REGION`, `GLOBAL_S3_BUCKET`, `STORAGE_TENANT_ID`) from upstream Supabase
- **Supabase** - Sync new environment variables to existing `supabase/docker/.env` during updates (previously only populated on first install)

## [1.3.3] - 2026-02-27

## [1.3.2] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed

## [1.2.4] - 2026-01-30

## [1.2.3] - 2026-01-29

### Fixed
- **Gost proxy** - Add Telegram domains to `GOST_NO_PROXY` bypass list for n8n Telegram triggers

## [1.2.2] - 2026-01-26
